BG-Connector
============

In 2005, BG-BASE and the Arboretum entered into an agreement to get data out of BG-BASE, and into a relational database that could be used with ArcGIS tools. MS SQL Server was chosen. 

In 2011, Putnam Fellow Brian Morgan, created the ArcGIS services that became the basis of web applications <a href="http://map.arboretum.harvard.edu/">Collection Researcher</a> and <a href="http://arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer">Arboretum Explorer</a>.
